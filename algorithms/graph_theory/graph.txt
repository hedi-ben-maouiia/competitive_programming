Graph Theory - Introduction 

Where we can find the Graph Theory in real life problems ? 

- Maps 
- Networking 

Graph it contain a Nodes and this nodes are connected with Edges.

Types of Edges :   
    - Indirected Edge --- 
    - Directed Edge   ---> 
    - Multiples Edges 

Fully connected node : edge = (n * (n - 1)) / 2 

Spre Graph : edge = n - 1

Dense Graph = fully connected 


Special Type of graph : Tree 

it only have one path between 2 nodes . 
edge = n - 1


Graph Represantation: 

Boolean Represantation:

1- Adjacency Matrix Represantation AMR[Nodes][Nodes] O(n2)

2- Adjacency List Represantation   ALR A->B->C[x]

Wheighted Represantation :

it can be Negative Wheighted edges Represantation

There is Stander's graph and other note standers
